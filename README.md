# WikiPathways Complexes

Reference drawings of complexes in [WikiPathways](https://wikipathways.org/) and matching
expectations of biological interactions to be captured in the resulting RDF. The approach
is modelled after [work by Ryan Miller et al.](https://github.com/RyAMiller/WikiPathwaysInteractions).
